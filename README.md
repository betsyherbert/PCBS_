# PCBS_MultilayerPerceptron

The aim of this project will be to create a Python library to implement a standard feedforward multilayer perceptron capable of solving a simple nonlinearly-separable problem such as XOR. I will aim to code the neural network architecture, matrix operations, backpropagation and gradient descent algorithms from scratch. I will then try to create some basic simulations to visualise the improvement of the network over training.
